The ANU Computer Science Students' Association is a society for students studying (or interested in) computer science, software engineering, and related fields.

We operate a common room on campus (N102 in the CSIT building, come say hi!); organise regular academic and social events, and events with industry sponsors; and a variety of other activities for the benefit of our members and the broader ANU community.

Membership is open to all ANU students at only $5 for the whole year. Drop by the common room or our stall on market day to sign up.
