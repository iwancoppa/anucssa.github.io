## Candidate Statements

### Zak Brighton-Knight

I want to be vice-president so that I can continue to foster the sense of community within the CSSA as well as improve the common room to entice more people to get involved with the CSSA community. As a member of the CSSA for the last three years I understand the diverse range of people in the CSSA and will strive to keep the CSSA as open and welcoming as possible for old and new members alike. I also want to run more events such as introduction to LaTeX, introduction to GNU/Linux and the terminal and introduction to working as a team using version control as I feel there is a no course in the university that prepares you to use these important CS tools

Preferences:
1. Vice-President
2. General Representative

### Sophie Chinn

I am a third year engineering and biology student. I have been a CRO for the past semester and an active member of CSSA for three years. In the past semester, I have actively helped the committee with events, such as filling out forms and helping with logistics. I have also done my best to maintain the common room by keeping it tidy. As Vice President or General Representative, I aim to reduce the workload of my committee members by providing the man power to assist other committee members in getting tasks done. Although I am not a computer science student, I can help through filling out forms, managing events and maintaining lines of communications so the other members can focus on academic quality of the event. I believe I work well in a team and I hope to contribute in making a committee that will improve the students’ wellbeing.

Preferences:
1. Vice-President
2. General Representative

### Jon Connor

Current holder of AGM, OGM, and committee meeting any% speed run records. I'll finish a meeting before you've even read this statement. 

Jokes aside, I'd be more than happy to continue for another year as the resident paperwork guy. 

Preferences:
1. Secretary
2. General Representative

### Joshua Corner

I try to be a positive influence on the common room, and on the committee’s decision making in general.

### Felix Friedlander

Hi! I've been a general representative for the past six months or so, and I'm the person who's brought you the new constitution, new website, most of the CSSA's recent graphic design, and (in association with the Returning Officer) the efficient counting of the most recent committee election.

Compared to the troubled times of the past, the CSSA committee currently runs smoothly and with a minimum of infighting, and as such I'm not running on the promise of fighting some great injustice or fixing a gaping hole.

Instead, I'd focus on the smaller things, like better communication - with members, with the school and course convenors, with our industry sponsors, with peer societies, and with ANUSA. The number of events that don't happen, or almost don't happen, or happen at a bad time, or are underwhelming, simply because of inadequate communication by the committee is in my mind too high.

I'd work to see the return of monthly speaker events, not just with industry partners but with individuals at the ANU and elsewhere. These have been a highlight in years past and the CSSA has hosted a number of interesting speakers. Introductory workshops on Linux command line usage, Git, and (La)TeX have also been hugely popular when they have run in the past, as they fill in gaps that are taught piecemeal or not at all in many CS courses. These are also good targets for joint events, for example with the ANU Mathematics Society.

On the social side, much has been done to make the CSSA inclusive, and indeed our membership is more diverse than CS courses at large, however I believe more can be done to run social events for the benefit of a larger section of our members.

Out of space now - thanks for reading!

Preferences:
1. President
2. Secretary
3. Vice-President
4. General Representative

### Rahul Ghangas

Come hear me at the AGM and you will know.

Preferences:
1. President
2. Vice-President

### Murdock Grewar

I am a second year PhD student; I've presented at a conference and proactively signed away intellectual property to a big company. 

During this process, after consulting an ANUSA lawyer, I argued back and forth with the company lawyers. My supervisors were able to negotiate a better contract where the company ownership over my intellectual property had a finite lifespan! While I would like to say I negotiated that myself, I at least represented my interests in the matter, which apparently other students hadn't done before.

I realised that these roles are an opportunity to commit involvement in a great community while learning some extra-curricular skills around personal and professional relationships. 

Preferences:
1. Industry Representative
2. Postgraduate Representative

### Robert Jeffrey

I've been the Vice-President under the Quarrel Presidency for the past two years, and I'm hoping to keep my role in the next committee.

I joked a lot in my first year that I did nothing, but I've since done my best to pick up the slack in organising our events & our committee. My main work this year was running the majority of our S1 study events (all three midsemester events and two of the final events) and working on the expansion of our vending machine empire.

My main goal in running for Vice-President is to support the organisation of the committee. I believe our committee mostly struggles with being organised in advance, and I want to work primarily on that. That means making sure our events are booked earlier than the week before, making sure our emails are managed and quickly responded to, ensuring tasks are properly assigned to individual people, and to follow up to make sure things gets done. 

In terms of overall aims,  if I was elected I'd want to continue our current events while expanding to new events. That includes expanding study events to more courses (e.g. COMP3600, COMP3670), running more industry & post-graduate events  in conjunction with committee,  running EGN again with as much planning as possible, and hopefully organising the committee to run the Sydney trip again. 

Preferences:
1. Vice-President
2. Secretary
3. General Representative

### Dana Pye

I'm Dana, I'm nonbinary and generally queer, and I'm running for diversity rep because I love the CSSA and I want to make it even better. Diversity is something that computer science struggles with as a discipline, for a lot of reasons. All kinds of diverse people enroll in CS degrees but many drop out because they can't find a welcoming community, and as the CS students association we can play a big role in changing that. I want to run events for different groups of people, work to make the common room and our events more accessible to all kinds of people, and act as a point of contact with committee for people who might not feel welcome because of their identities. I am a member of the queer department, women's department and disabilities student association, so I can represent a wide range of diversity, in a way that is helpful to the CSSA and to computer science students in general.

Preferences:
1. Diversity Representative
2. General Representative

### David Quarel

I run Epic Games Night, and the study events. I tutor lots of first year courses, putting me in a situation well suited to handle study events.

### Sylvester Shan

I think I could be helpful others to organising events, but not helpful to organise an event xd 

### Abigail Thomas

Imagine having a postgrad rep who's actually a postgrad? I've had some ideas for how we could tailor study events to postgrad and later-year students, based on interest area rather than a specific course. Should be fun.

### Christopher Ward

I have been on committee since March 2017. Since then, I have helped run many events (mostly in barbecue catering, to save money), improved our funding through vending machine acquisitions, and assisted with the rearrangement and cleaning of the common room at the start of the year. 

Since the end of the financial year, I have migrated the accounts of the CSSA to Xero, improving accountability and budgeting. The new accounting structure allows for much clearer identification of income and expense streams, which will allow us to budget more appropriately and focus on spending money in a way that enriches the CS student experience. I have some experience in bookkeeping in Xero from running as a sole trader for a few personal business endeavours.

I was also responsible for writing the new membership tracking app, and am working on new features for the app, including a self-service membership portal and automatic newsletter management.

Preferences:
1. Treasurer
2. General Representiative

### Leopold Zhou

I'd like to be the International Representative for 2020. 

I am a business student who happen to be keen on computer science and love free software spirit. I happen to have interpersonal skills to deal effectively with guys from multicultural background. I have a vision to make it more accessible for international students to engage in CSSA. I have been working hard planning ways to implement that vision. I believe I have the necessary transferable skills demonstrated through working in other societies and my job. I have had a wonderful experience in CSSA and I want to help more international students to have the same.

“Talk is cheap so what about showing you the real work :-)”

Preferences:
1. International Representative
2. General Representative
