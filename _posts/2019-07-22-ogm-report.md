2019's first Ordinary General Meeting was held today, primarily to
consider the CSSA's proposed new constitution. The constitution was
adopted as proposed except for one amendment allowing non-students to
run for the position of General Representative. The constitution is
available on the [resources page](/resources).

Additionally, a motion was passed to make long-time supporter Tyrus
Caldeira a life member of the CSSA. Tyrus has worked tirelessly for
years assisting the CSSA with all manner of projects, and has been
especially involved with organising Epic Games Nights for some time.
The committee would like to congratulate Tyrus on this achievement.

Thanks again to everyone that turned up to the meeting to ask questions
or raise concerns - like any democracy, the CSSA works better the more
voices are heard.

Minutes from the meeting will be made available shortly on the
[resources page](/resources) and on Facebook.
