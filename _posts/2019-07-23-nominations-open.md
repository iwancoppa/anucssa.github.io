Following our OGM yesterday, the CSSA committee is pleased to announce
that our new constitution is now in effect. In accordance with that
constitution, the CSSA would like to invite any nominations for the
2020 CSSA committee.

The following positions are open for nominations:

*	President
*	Vice-President
*	Treasurer
*	Secretary
*	Industry Representative
*	Postgraduate Representative
*	Diversity Representative
*	International Representative
*	General Representatives (3)

Note that to nominate for any position other than General
Representative, you must be a current ANU student.

To apply for one or more positions, please fill out the [nomination
form](https://anucssa.typeform.com/to/sIe4Ub).

Your candidate statement will be published to all members prior to the
Annual General Meeting (to be held on the 23rd of August - time and
location TBC). Elections for contested positions will be held at the
AGM.

All nominations are welcome - if you're keen to get involved, even if
you've not had much involvement with the CSSA committee in the past,
why not give something new a go?
