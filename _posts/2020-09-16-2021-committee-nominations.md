## Candidate Statements

### David Quarel

I'm a tutor, and I like running study events, and being a link between courses and the CSSA.

Preferences:
1. General Representative

### Talyah Livanes

Hi, I’m Talyah Livanes – most students and staff know me personally and online as Cappy. I’m a 23 year old undergraduate student undertaking a Bachelor of Design and I have nominated myself primarily for General Representative and also the Secretary role for the upcoming CSSA election.

Although based in the ANU School of Art and Design, I have always held a keen eye for Computer Science and Information Technology, picking up various courses as electives throughout my time at ANU.
As things are now, I have a strong online presence throughout the ANU affiliated discord servers, especially as admin of the ANU Students discord server. With 2020 and all the challenges it has given us, I have amped up my involvement with the community as the online environment became our new norm.

As ANU continues to adapt to the challenges presented by this year and the next and converts into a hybrid learning institution, I hope to be a part of CSSA as either a General Representative or a Secretary, utilising my skills and experience to create a rewarding atmosphere both online and on-campus for students. If elected in either of my nominated roles, I will be committed to creating a more engaging, inclusive, and fulfilling community for the already welcoming and vibrant CSSA.

Thank you!
Preferences:
1. Secretary
2. General Representative

### Thomas Burnett

G’day, I’m Thomas. Next year I’ll be in my second year of a predominately physics and maths undergrad, with a bit of compsci sprinkled around.

In my year as a member, the CSSA has connected me with CTF cyber-sec comps, competitive programming, and has been there in the group chat to help troubleshoot misbehaving code or computers. For this I am grateful, and I see attributes like these, along with the culture, as being foundational to the Association.

If elected as a gen-rep, I would view issues through the lens of inclusivity of all students regardless of if their degree says CompSci. CSSA has helped satiate my need for compsci, and open my eyes further to the field. I would be honoured to help others in this way as a 2021 gen-rep.

If elected as secretary, I will do the required work early, and effectively. Mail merge, timetabling, clear immersive \LaTeX minutes, early notification of upcoming dates, who doesn’t love these sorts of things? You want them? I can provide them. That’s my pitch.

Preferences:
1. Secretary
2. General Representative

### Sylvester Shan

Yeet it

Preferences:
1. General Representative

### Felix Friedlander

Hi! It's been a long year for us all, so I'll keep it brief.

In short: I feel like I've been taking the CSSA in a reasonable direction as President, and I've plenty more plans (as a result of COVID, many of these plans are essentially last year's plans).

In addition to all the stuff I said last year, however, I plan on having a big focus on enabling the rest of our committee to do the most they can for the society. (I'm already working on this, a little.)

A more detailed description of where I've taken the society and where I think we're going will be in my President's Report, if you're interested. Otherwise, I apologise for the shameful lack of free food this year; we'll find a way to do better one way or another.

Out of space now - thanks for reading!

Preferences:
1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Secretary
4. General Representative

### Robert Jeffrey

I was Vice-President between 2017 and 2019. I'm hoping to help the CSSA find ways of engaging with first-year students, running social events that work during remote teaching, and organising academic events for students to learn about interesting new research.

Preferences:
1. General Representative


### Elias Yuan

Before I launch into the classic "tugs at your heartstrings" speech, I'd
like to preface: Were I to be elected secretary, I will make it my mission
to release minutes within this decade, in contrast with every CSSA secretary
since Rachel, so I'm told. They will be pretty and typeset in LaTeX.

TL;DR of the rest of this statement: I'd very much like to do the thing.

I've been very engaged with the CSSA ever since I landed in Canberra
(February this year), and have thoroughly enjoyed my time on committee as
General Representative (from April). The CSSA has helped me find a community
in a foreign place, as well as provided a place to learn the things that I
don't get to learn in class. The people here have put me back on a path that
makes sense when I've gotten lost navigating bureaucracy, and showed me that
I could be so many things that I didn't know were possible before.

I'd like to help this world grow, to the best of my capability, as I've
found my family here. _I'd like to give back._

Under the guidance of the 2020 committee, and others, I've learnt much about
the inner workings of societies and clubs, and it is very much something I'd
like to be more involved in, especially seeing the joy it brings, and can
_continue_ to bring, to people -- whether they be new to the school, area,
or returning for yet _another_ year.

I'm currently completing a BAC(R&D)/BS, and probably will continue to do so
for another 6 years, poking around the areas of systems, logic, algorithms,
as well as pure maths and maybe some physics if I can jam it in.


Preferences:
1. Secretary
2. Vice-President
3. Diversity Representative
4. General Representative

### Sandy Ma

Hello :) My name is Sandy and I would love to be your industry rep again!

My term started when I filled in a casual vacancy so admittedly I did not get a lot of time to prepare for the role - if elected, I’ll be sure to spend the Summer preparing for some amazing sponsors and spicy sponsored events in O-Week.

Rona ruined a lot of my hopes and dreams for this year and I hope to use the opportunity of a second term to make those dreams come true.

Dreams include:
- Hackathons
- Resume workshops
- Mock interviews
- Networking events

All with industry mentors available to maximise our employability in the field!!

Preferences:
1. Industry Representative

### Dana Pye (They/Them)

Hi all! I've been the diversity rep this year and I'd love to do it again. Even though this year limited the events we could run, I've built connections with CECS diversity and inclusion, ESA Queer* and Women's reps, and Science Soc Queer*

I'm in the process of working with school and ESA to run autonomous Queer* meetups for CECS students, and I'm admin of the ANU Queer* STEM facebook group.

Next year I want to keep working on Queer* community events, making CSSA spaces welcoming for people who might not always feel welcome in computer science spaces, and generally making our community an even better place than it is.

Preferences:
1. Diversity Representative
2. General Representative

### Abigail Thomas

Did it last year, didn't get to do much bc covid, hopefully we can get back to doing stuff in person soon but if not I'm thinking about having an online chat.

Preferences:
1. Postgraduate Representative

### Sophie Chinn

As Vice-President in the last term, I have done my best to support the CSSA committee members, from doing paperwork and filling out society forms to working with people to keep to deadlines and providing emotional support, especially in this remote-learning environment. The past term has proven that having someone on exec with a entirely different timetable than the rest of the team really helps with keeping projects on track. As the "resident biologist", I would like to continue serving on any exec position so when everyone needs to dash off to do comp assignments, I can "hold the fort" and keep the society running until they are all free. I would like to let you decide which role I would serve best in, whether it be utilizing my scheduling and people skills as Vice-Pres, implementing my love for paperwork as Secretary, or be a hardworking gen rep. I believe that whatever role I will be selected for, I can serve my fellow ANU students effectively.

Preferences:
1. Vice-President
2. Secretary
3. General Representative

### Nayoon Kim

First and foremost, if I get elected as a Vice President, I will focus on assisting the President organising events, doing my best for CSSA, and giving both academic and career support to students. Although there are not many events due to COVID recently, I will work for events such as Installfest, Virtual Games Night, and talks to run successfully. I will help students tired of COVID. I would like to contribute to CSSA and ensure a pleasing environment for all students. I will do whatever I can to support and improve CSSA. On top of that, I’ll work to make sure our study events and industry talks to continue smoothly do that CSSA becomes a society that every CS student wants to join and actively be involved. I want to be part of creating my fun and fruitful events and programmes for all students to gain something, and meet other people. Moreover, as an international student, I would like to offer additional assistance needed for international members here in CSSA - I believe there are quite numbers of them- especially when I can understand your needs.

Preferences:
1. Vice-President
2. Secretary
3. International Representative


### Leopold Zhou

Hi all! I’m Leo. I’m a second year computer science and business student. I’ve been the International Representative since 2019. I’m keen on participating in CSSA events and helped organise a few. You might have met me in those study events (hopefully they can be back in person soon). Engaging actively in this community has brought me a wonderful experience. I hope to bring it to more international students.

My experience and background enable me with adequate interpersonal skills to deal effectively with people from multicultural backgrounds. That said, 2020 disrupted many of my plans, one of which is an international dinner. I hope to bring it to you in the coming year. I’m currently working on the International partnership program which will help CSSA get in touch with CS-related societies around the world so that our members can have a channel communicating with CS students from different backgrounds. I have contacted societies from several universities and I’d like to launch the pilot phase in this semester.

Again, “Talk is so cheap”, I’d like to show you the real work :-).

Preferences:
1. International Representiative
2. General Representiative

### Chris Ward

In my time as treasurer in the last year, I've migrated the CSSA accounts to Xero, allowing us to clearly see where our income and expenses lie, and to ensure our funds are used appropriately. I have also continued to maintain our vending machine fleet to ensure additional revenue for the society.

Preferences:
1. Treasurer
2. General Representative
