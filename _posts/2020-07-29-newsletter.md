Welcome to Semester 2!

Hopefully these first few days of remote learning have treated you
well. The CSSA is starting this semester's social calendar off right
away, with our

Yes, that's TONIGHT!

We'll be co-ordinating everything through the CSSA Discord - if you
aren't there already, you can join with this link: 
<https://discord.gg/UETrGuS>.

There'll be Minecraft, Urban Terror, social deception games, various
game tournaments thanks to the amazing people at ANU Esports, and
more -- come join in the fun and kick off the semester right!

Of course, the start of semester is more than an opportunity to catch
up with friends, and without in-person tutorials, setting up your
computer with everything you need for the new semester can be tricky.

Never fear, the CSSA is also running our regular

INSTALLFEST

Friday, 31 July, 5PM - 8PM

We'll be there to help you get set up for COMP1110/1140 or COMP2310, as
well as the VDI that many courses (including COMP1100) are using.

Just like many of your courses, we'll be using Microsoft Teams to run
this event - join the CSSA team at <https://cssa.club/team>.
