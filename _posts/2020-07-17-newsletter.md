Hello from the ANU CSSA!

Like many student societies, we have been somewhat dormant over the
past months, which have affected everyone in different ways. However,
while it looks like CS will be anything but "normal" this coming
semester, we'll be doing our very best to keep you connected,
entertained, and supported.

We have a bunch of events in the works! In particular, save the date
for our fully remote Bush Week games night - Wednesday 29th July. Some
exciting merchandise should also be coming soon. As always, you can
keep updated by reading this newsletter, checking our website at 
<https://cssa.club>, and keeping up with our social media.

Due to the University's COVID-19 precautions, the common room may not
be open for some time. Rest assured we are working tirelessly to ensure
the common room opens the minute it is safe and permitted to, and we'll
keep you updated. For those looking for another way to stay engaged
with the society, you can join our Discord at 
<https://discord.gg/UETrGuS> - it's a great way to connect with
everyone in and around the CSSA.

After an absolutely crazy first semester, the College of Engineering
and Computer Science is looking to recognise tutors, lecturers, and
other teaching staff who've done a particularly good job of supporting
their students despite everything. You can nominate anyone, or any
course, that impressed you at <https://cecs.anu.edu.au/remote-teaching-and-student-experience-awards-semester-1-2020> -
nominations close on Monday (20th July), and the form is very simple,
so if you're thinking about submitting one, why not do it now!

Remember, if you want to share your specific experiences of remote
learning, be it praise, criticism, or ideas for improvement, the CSSA
is always happy to hear from you - drop us a line at
<anucssa@anu.edu.au> or on any of our social platforms.
