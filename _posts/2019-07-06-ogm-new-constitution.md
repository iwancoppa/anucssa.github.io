title: "Ordinary General Meeting (New Constitution)"
date: 2019-07-06
---
The CSSA has for some time been considering its constitution. The
current constitution has been amended over time, but ultimately dates
back to 2011 and the re-affiliation of the society. It has served us
well, however there are some sections that are unworkable or have
unfortunate consequences, and many of us in the committee feel that the
time has come for a fresh start.

The proposed new constitution has been in the works for a while, and it
is finally ready for public consideration.

With that said, the CSSA committee hereby gives notice of an

Ordinary General Meeting
------------------------

to be held at 6:30pm on the 22nd of July in Room N102 (Computer Science & Information Technology building) to consider the following agenda:

> 1. Opening and Acknowledgement
>
> 2. Motions with Notice
>
>>> Motion 2.1. That the constitution of the CSSA be replaced with the
>>> following: [pdf](/assets/draft-constitution.pdf)

Nice and simple!

Food will be provided, and our usual Monday Games Night will be
starting immediately after the conclusion of the general meeting.

If you have any questions or suggestions relating to the new
constitution, please don't hesitate to contact
<felix.friedlander@anu.edu.au>.

For some idea of what needed improving, [have a read](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EaKaSUkR_jTYRaxiXc1v8uuzZxzowhJV/view?usp=sharing) of the old constitution
(or ask anyone who has tried to run a CSSA election without violating
it!)

Hope to see you there!
